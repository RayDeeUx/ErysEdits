# ErysEdits
Several mods I would've made into smaller standalone mods when I was an ignorant Geode developer. (And I still probably am by several accounts, but who's keeping track? `/j`)

Not all features of ErysEdits are available across all platforms; check your settings for this mod after installing to verify.

## Features
- Various Info Label tweaks, including improved readibility, conditional displays, and debug text logging

- Viewing level descriptions from level lists and daily/weekly levels (compatible with nearly every possible mod that edits the LevelCell, including Cvolton's BetterInfo + Compact Level Lists, cdc's Level Thumbnails, n's Level Pronouns, and dankmeme's Globed)

![demoThree](raydeeux.erysedits/demoThree.png&scale:0.75)

- Hide "Level Complete" visuals (except particles, use your local mod menu to hide those)

- Disabling the cube jump animation in platformer levels (hitbox trail for reference)

![demoSix](raydeeux.erysedits/demoSix.png&scale:0.75)

- Various FLAlertLayers tweaks (including wider alerts, smaller, text, and scrollable text)

![demoSeven](raydeeux.erysedits/demoSeven.png&scale:0.75)

- Hidden progress bar and percentage on unverified local levels
- Various keybinds to make navigating Geometry Dash feel a lot less repetive (Ctrl + S to save, Ctrl + R to refresh, Alt + Left/Right to navigate between layers with pages, Shift + Left/Right to go to the first or last page, etc)
- Requiring Shift key to enter shops and vaults (to avoid changing menu loop music)
- Disable Shake, Pulse, Area Tint, SFX, and Edit SFX triggers
