# ErysEdits Changelog
## v1.1.1
- Fix a silly bug with the debug text's `Compact "Gameplay" Section` setting. Oops!
## v1.1.0
- New slider settings: `Always Active LDM` and `Level End Screen: Show Mods List`. Make sure to read their config descriptions!
- A few miscellaneous settings for tidying up the icon kit. 
- Removed the setting that forces the player death SFX to play. Please use similar settings in v1.1.0 of Adam729's Random Death Sounds mod instead.
- Remove disabling the platformer cube jump squishing animation. Please use similar settings in v1.2.0 of RayDeeUx's BreakingPlatforming mod instead.
- Clarify descriptions when levels appear to have an empty description despite proven otherwise, especially when browsing level lists.
- Fix an issue where SFX in some levels would infinitely loop. Thank you, Aktimoose, for bringing this to my attention, and deepest apologies for rejecting your original claims. I hope this apology and this update is compensation enough for my harsh behavior at the time.
- Unfortunately, there's still incredibly specific edge cases where SFX *can* loop infinitely while using this mod, so a config description has been added to the relevant spot.
