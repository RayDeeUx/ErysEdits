# ErysEdits Changelog
## v1.1.0
- Add an additional keybind to save and exit an editor level.
- Add a keybind to open the Geode mods list, almost accessible anywhere.
- Add a keybind to open this mod's settings, also almost accessible anywhere.
- Add keybinds to (toggle between viewing/creating new) local editor levels and local level lists.
- Remove forcing player death SFX settings (please use v1.1.0 of Adam729's Random Death Sounds mod instead).
- Fix an issue where SFX in some levels would infinitely loop. Thank you, Aktimoose, for bringing this to my attention, and deepest apologies for rejecting your original claims. I hope this apology and this update is compensation enough for my harsh behavior at the time.
- Added punctuation to changelogs.
- Bump Node IDs minimum requirement to v1.9.1.
- [Windows only] Bump Custom Keybinds minimum requirement to v1.5.6.
## v1.0.2
- Rebuild the mod due to *someone* mangling up `FLAlertLayer` codegen for Android.
- Fix funky text scaling behavior in `FLAlertLayer`s with scrolling enabled by default.
## v1.0.1
- Less restrictive width caps on `FLAlertLayer` (anything wider than 420 units before being modified by ErysEdits is unaffected).
- "Brought back" Soggy Mod re-compatibility.
## v1.0.0
- Initial release (on GitHub).
